## üß† What I Build

**Reinforcement Learning Systems** ‚Äî Training agents that make sequential decisions in complex environments. From custom Gymnasium environments to production-grade RL frameworks optimized for financial markets.

**ML Configuration & Experimentation** ‚Äî Type-safe frameworks for hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, and experiment tracking. Tools that eliminate boilerplate and enforce best practices from research to production.

**High-Performance ML Pipelines** ‚Äî Python that runs fast. Custom Numba kernels, efficient data pipelines processing 100M+ row datasets, and optimization strategies that matter when milliseconds count.

**Production ML Tools** ‚Äî Open-source libraries built from real research needs: configuration frameworks, financial data scrapers, proxy rotation systems, and infrastructure that bridges the gap between papers and deployment.
