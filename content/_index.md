## üß† What I Build

**Reinforcement Learning Systems** ‚Äî Training agents that make sequential decisions in complex environments. From custom Gymnasium environments to production-grade RL frameworks optimized for financial markets.

**High-Performance ML Pipelines** ‚Äî Python that runs fast. Custom Numba kernels, efficient data pipelines processing 100M+ row datasets, and optimization strategies that matter when milliseconds count.

**Production ML Tools** ‚Äî Open-source libraries built from real research needs: financial data scrapers, proxy rotation systems, and frameworks that bridge the gap between papers and deployment.

## üéØ Current Focus

Developing novel RL architectures for algorithmic trading. Reformulating traditional actor-critic methods into more efficient multi-armed bandit frameworks. Building the infrastructure to train at scale.

Shipping open-source tools that other researchers and engineers actually use:
