## üë§ Background

I've spent the last eight years building AI systems‚Äînot the kind that generate memes, but the kind that make decisions under uncertainty, process massive datasets, and run in production without falling over.

Started in urban engineering, quickly realized I needed more logic and less art. Switched to computer science. Built and scaled a retail business to fund my education, then left it to focus entirely on what actually kept me awake at night: making machines learn.

## üõ§Ô∏è The Journey

**2016-2017 ‚Ä¢ First Company** ‚Äî Co-founded MasterCom, tried game development, realized I was more interested in the systems than the games. Pivoted to UI development with Qt/QML. Shipped 13+ projects. Learned what I didn't want to do.

**2017-2018 ‚Ä¢ Financial Markets** ‚Äî Discovered Forex trading. Six months of pure research before touching a demo account. Built backtesting systems, learned signal processing, feature engineering, risk management. Realized simple strategies don't work‚Äîmarkets are adversarial.

**2018-2020 ‚Ä¢ Deep Learning** ‚Äî Dove into machine learning. Andrew Ng's courses, then straight into PyTorch. Computer vision, NLP, time-series forecasting. Read papers as they dropped from arXiv. Built a dual RTX 2080 Ti rig. Implemented everything from scratch to understand how it actually works.

**2020-2021 ‚Ä¢ Dideo (Video Platform)** ‚Äî First real ML role. Built data pipelines processing petabytes of visual data. Custom Numba kernels that beat C++ implementations. Synthetic data generation systems. Learned production ML isn't just about accuracy‚Äîit's about throughput, maintainability, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

**2021-2022 ‚Ä¢ Deep RL** ‚Äî Deep dive into reinforcement learning. Traditional RL, then Deep RL. Built custom Gymnasium environments. Trained agents on financial markets. Spent six months failing to make stable models‚Äîlearned more from failure than from any tutorial. Built scalable RL frameworks from scratch.

**2022-2024 ‚Ä¢ MetaScape (Fintech)** ‚Äî Built news scraping pipelines, sentiment analysis systems, portfolio optimization with RL. First experience with production CI/CD, structured logging, and the reality that 80% of ML engineering is data engineering.

**2024-Present ‚Ä¢ Independent Research** ‚Äî Reformulating trading as multi-armed bandits instead of sequential RL. Building systems that scale. Shipping open-source tools. Looking for the next challenge.

## üí≠ Technical Philosophy

**Theory is the map; implementation is the territory.** I read papers to understand principles, then build systems to find out what actually works. Most breakthrough papers have implementation details that make or break their claims.

**Optimization isn't premature if you understand the bottleneck.** Custom Numba kernels, memory-mapped arrays, vectorized operations‚Äîthese aren't tricks, they're prerequisites when you're processing 100M+ rows.

**Production systems need different skills than research code.** Type safety with Pydantic, comprehensive logging, graceful degradation, monitoring, testing‚Äîthese aren't optional. They're what separates a notebook from a product.

**The best code is boring code.** Clear names, simple logic, obvious structure. Clever code is a liability. Maintainable code is an asset.

## üåç Current Situation

Based in Iran. Married. Just got my passport after resolving military service exemption (medical). Dealing with 200%+ annual inflation, frequent power outages, economic collapse, and the aftermath of literal war.

I'm not leaving because Iran is bad at tech‚Äîthere are brilliant people here. I'm leaving because constraints compound. Every project requires workarounds. Every tool requires VPNs. Every transaction requires currency exchange calculations. Every plan includes "what if the internet goes down again."

I have about 1-2 years of runway with current savings and passive income. Looking for opportunities where I can focus on building systems instead of navigating geopolitics.

## üéØ What I'm Looking For

Research labs or companies working on:
- Deep RL for real-world control problems
- Financial ML / quantitative systems  
- Large-scale ML infrastructure
- Systems that actually ship to users

Places where "we should try that paper" leads to "here's the implementation" within days, not months. Teams that value builders over talkers.
