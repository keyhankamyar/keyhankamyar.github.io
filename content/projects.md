## ðŸ’¼ Production Work

Throughout my career, I've built production systems that aren't open-source but demonstrate real-world ML engineering:

**Sentiment Analysis Pipeline** â€” MetaScape, 2022-2024  
News scraping, SBERT embeddings, financial sentiment classification with 69% accuracy. Handled automatic retraining and drift detection in production.

**Synthetic Data Generation** â€” Dideo, 2020-2021  
Human-in-the-loop system for nudity detection. Achieved 200x speedup in data generation through active learning and automatic nightly finetuning.

**RL Trading Framework** â€” Independent, 2021-Present  
Custom Gymnasium environments, distributed training, HPO + NAS pipelines. Multi-armed bandit reformulation of trading problems. Currently training at scale (compute-limited).

**Defect Detection** â€” Contract Work, 2022  
YOLOv7-based quality control for pottery manufacturing. Reduced supervision staff from 5 to 1 with just a PC and webcam.
