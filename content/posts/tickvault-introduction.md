If you've ever tried to work with financial market data at scale, you know the problems:

**Arbitrary resampling** that hides the movements you actually care about. Your model says enter at $1,850.23, exit at $1,850.89—but your hourly candle shows High: $1,851.20, Low: $1,849.80. Did your stop-loss trigger first, or did you hit take-profit? The data doesn't tell you.

**Tools that break at scale**. Libraries that crash on large downloads, can't resume, take forever to decode, or try to load everything into memory. Half are abandoned, the other half weren't built for production workloads.

**Rate limits** that turn a 3-day download into a 3-week ordeal. Dukascopy's free datafeed is great—until you need 30 symbols across 20 years and you're suddenly bottlenecked at 5 requests per second.

**Expensive APIs** for data that should be free. Why pay hundreds per month when the raw data exists, if only there was a decent way to access it?

Over the past few months, I downloaded and decoded 2,000,000+ hours of tick data from Dukascopy. Not because I enjoy infrastructure work—because I needed it for reinforcement learning research and nothing else worked. So I built TickVault.

## The Design

I built TickVault around three principles:

**Mirror Dukascopy's structure 1:1.** No reformatting, no "clever" reorganization. The filesystem layout matches the source URLs exactly. No surprises when you need to debug. Single source of truth.

**Store raw, compressed data.** Keep the original .bi5 files as-is. If you change your resampling strategy in 6 months, you don't re-download terabytes. If you need to reproduce results from a year ago, the data hasn't been pre-processed into irrelevance. ELT over ETL—extract and store, transform when you need it.

**Decode on-demand.** You want one day of EUR/USD? Decompress those 24 hourly chunks. You want 5 years of 30 symbols? Same code path, just more chunks. Memory usage stays constant because you're not loading everything upfront.

Here's what that looks like in practice:
```bash
pip install tick-vault
```

Download a month of gold tick data:
```python
from datetime import datetime
from tick_vault import download_range

await download_range(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
)
```

Read it back as a pandas DataFrame:
```python
from tick_vault import read_tick_data

df = read_tick_data(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
)

print(df.head())
# time                     ask        bid      ask_volume  bid_volume
# 2024-01-01 00:00:01.234  2062.450  2062.430  150         230
# ...
```

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

### The Resampling Trap

Most data sources give you pre-resampled data—hourly candles, 5-minute bars, daily OHLC. But who decided that's the right granularity for your problem?

If you're training an ML model, why would you assume 1-hour bins are the optimal feature resolution? And even if hourly happens to work, why assume that Open, High, Low, Close captures what matters? You're throwing away every tick between those four points.

Worse: **resampled data breaks risk calculations.** 

Say your strategy generates an entry at $1,850.23 and an exit at $1,850.89—a tight 66-pip window. Your stop-loss is at $1,849.95. The next hourly candle shows:
- Open: $1,850.10
- High: $1,851.20  
- Low: $1,849.80
- Close: $1,850.95

Did you hit your take-profit at $1,850.89? Or did the price drop to $1,849.95 first and stop you out? **The candle doesn't tell you.** You can't calculate your actual risk, can't validate your strategy, can't trust your backtest.

Even if your entry and exit are far apart, sudden volatility can create the same problem. A single hourly candle that spans $10 might contain a flash crash that would have stopped you out—but the OHLC makes it look like smooth sailing.

If you're serious about modeling market dynamics, you need tick-level data. Everything else is a lossy approximation.

### Tools That Don't Scale

So you decide you need tick data. You search GitHub for "dukascopy python" and find... a graveyard.

**Half the repos haven't been touched in 3+ years.** Broken dependencies, no type hints, no tests. READMEs that promise the world but crash on Python 3.9+. They worked once, for someone, in 2018.

**The active ones weren't built for production.** You start downloading 2 years of EUR/USD. Six hours in, your connection drops. Start over from scratch—there's no resume logic. Or manually figure out which chunks are missing and pray your script handles partial state.

**Memory management is an afterthought.** Some libraries load entire datasets into RAM before processing. Fine for a weekend of data. Catastrophic when you need 10 years across 30 symbols and your laptop has 16GB. Your kernel just got killed.

**Decoding is painfully slow.** Single-threaded, pure Python loops processing millions of ticks. Every inefficiency compounds when you're working at scale. What should take minutes takes hours.

I duct-taped together scripts for a year—custom resume logic, manual retry handling, homegrown decoders. Then I got tired of maintaining infrastructure when I should have been training models.

### The Bandwidth Bottleneck

Dukascopy's datafeed is free and high-quality. It's also aggressively rate-limited.

You can download maybe 5-10 requests per second before you start getting 429s (rate limit errors) or 503s (service unavailable). That's fine if you're grabbing a week of one symbol. It's a nightmare when you need:

- 30 currency pairs
- 20 years of history each  
- 24 hourly chunks per day
- = 5,256,000 individual requests

At 5 requests/second with perfect uptime, that's **12 days of continuous downloading.** In practice, with retries, backoff delays, and occasional connection issues? Closer to 3 weeks.

And that's assuming you're using a single connection. Most libraries don't support concurrent downloads, let alone proxy rotation to distribute load. You're stuck babysitting a single-threaded script for weeks, hoping nothing crashes overnight.

**The bottleneck isn't your internet connection. It's the architecture of the tools.**

### The Cost vs Quality Tradeoff

You could just pay for data. Plenty of vendors will sell you tick data—$500/month, $2,000/month, enterprise contracts with minimums.

For a hedge fund, that's a rounding error. For an independent researcher, a grad student, or someone in a country where $500/month is half a salary? It's a non-starter.

And you're often paying for **convenience, not quality.** Many paid APIs are just reselling the same Dukascopy data you could get for free, wrapped in a nicer interface. You're paying someone else to solve the download problem.

Which would be fine—if the free tools actually worked. But they don't. So you're stuck choosing between:

- Expensive APIs that solve the problem but price out independent research
- Free data that's high-quality but inaccessible without building infrastructure
- Resampled garbage that's easy to get but useless for serious work

**There should be a fourth option: free, high-quality, and actually usable at scale.** That's what TickVault is.

## How TickVault Works Differently

I didn't want to build "yet another Dukascopy wrapper." I wanted to solve the underlying architectural problems that make existing tools fragile.

### Store Raw, Mirror 1:1

TickVault's filesystem structure mirrors Dukascopy's URL structure exactly:
```
tick_vault_data/
└── downloads/
    └── XAUUSD/
        └── 2024/
            └── 02/          # Month: 0-indexed (00=Jan, 11=Dec)
                └── 15/      # Day
                    ├── 00h_ticks.bi5
                    ├── 01h_ticks.bi5
                    └── ...
```

Every file is stored in its original compressed `.bi5` format. No reformatting, no "clever" reorganization, no pre-processing.

**Why this matters:**

**Single source of truth.** When something breaks, you know exactly where to look. The file at `XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5` corresponds to `https://datafeed.dukascopy.com/datafeed/XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5`. No mental mapping required.

**Reproducibility.** Your resampling strategy from 6 months ago produced different results today? The raw data hasn't changed—you can investigate. With pre-processed data, you're just guessing.

**Storage efficiency.** Compressed tick data is surprisingly small. 20 years of Gold (200,000+ hourly files) is ~15GB. Keep the originals, transform on-demand.

**Future-proof.** Decide you need millisecond timestamps instead of your current second-level precision? The raw ticks are still there. You're not locked into past decisions.

This is ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) instead of ETL. Get the data once, transform it however many times you need.

### Metadata-Driven Resume

Every download attempt gets tracked in a SQLite database:
```
metadata.db
├── symbol_XAUUSD
│   ├── timestamp: 1704067200  (2024-01-01 00:00 UTC)
│   ├── has_data: 1
│   └── ...
└── symbol_EURUSD
    └── ...
```

Each symbol gets its own table. Each hour gets a row with two pieces of information:
1. Did we attempt to download it?
2. Does data exist for this hour? (Some hours legitimately have no data—weekends for forex, market holidays, etc.)

**Why this matters:**

**True resume capability.** Your download crashes at hour 50,000? Run the same command again. TickVault checks the database, skips what's already done, continues from where it left off. No manual state tracking.

**Incremental updates.** Downloaded data through March? Now it's June? Just set `end=datetime.now()` and TickVault only fetches the new chunks. Your historical data stays untouched.

**Gap detection.** Before reading data, TickVault verifies continuity. Missing hours in the middle of your range? It tells you before you waste time on a broken dataset.

**The producer-consumer pattern:** Download workers (producers) fetch chunks concurrently and push results to a queue. A single metadata worker (consumer) batches database writes. This avoids database lock contention while maintaining consistency—even with 50 parallel workers hammering away.

### Parallel Everything

TickVault's download architecture is built around concurrency:
```
Orchestrator
├── Proxy A → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
├── Proxy B → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
└── Proxy C → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
     ↓
  Result Queue
     ↓
  Metadata Worker (single writer)
```

Each proxy gets its own pool of async workers (default: 10 per proxy). Each worker:
1. Pulls a chunk from the work queue
2. Fetches it via `httpx` with retry logic
3. Saves the compressed data to disk
4. Reports the result to the metadata worker

**Why this matters:**

**Speed.** With 3 proxies and 10 workers each, you're making 30 concurrent requests. That 12-day download? Now it's done in hours.

**Rate limit mitigation.** Dukascopy rate-limits per IP. Distributing requests across proxies means you're not constantly hitting 429s and backing off.

**Fault tolerance.** One worker crashes? The other 29 keep going. One proxy gets blocked? Its workers fail gracefully while the others continue. The orchestrator handles backpressure—if downloads are faster than metadata writes, the queue fills up and workers naturally slow down.

**Exponential backoff with context.** Transient network error? Retry with increasing delays. Rate limit with `Retry-After` header? Respect it. Forbidden/blocked? Fail fast and stop wasting time.

The async architecture means you're not waiting on I/O. While one worker is waiting for a response, 29 others are fetching, decoding, or writing.

### Decode On-Demand

TickVault doesn't pre-process anything. The `.bi5` files stay compressed on disk until you actually need them.

When you call `read_tick_data()`:
1. Query the metadata database for available chunks in your time range
2. Verify there are no gaps (fail fast if data is incomplete)
3. Load each compressed chunk sequentially
4. Decompress with LZMA, decode with NumPy structured arrays
5. Concatenate into a single pandas DataFrame

**Why this matters:**

**Memory efficiency.** You can store 10TB of compressed data and work with 1GB at a time. The same code works whether you're reading one day or ten years—memory usage stays constant because you're streaming through chunks, not loading everything upfront.

**Flexibility.** Want to resample to 5-minute bars today and 1-second bars tomorrow? The raw ticks are still there. Want to calculate VWAP using actual volumes instead of approximations? You have the data. Every transformation is non-destructive.

**Fast enough.** Decompression and decoding are fast—LZMA is optimized, NumPy handles binary parsing efficiently. For most use cases, the bottleneck is your analysis code, not the data loading.

**Coming soon:** Incremental decode-to-database pipelines. Stream chunks directly to SQLite or HDF5 for efficient querying without loading into memory. Same raw source files, different materialization strategies—pick what fits your workflow.

The pattern is simple: **download once, transform many times.** Keep the highest-resolution version, derive everything else as needed.

## Show Me the Code

### Basic Workflow
```bash
pip install tick-vault
```

Download and read:
```python
from datetime import datetime
from tick_vault import download_range, read_tick_data

# Download a month of gold tick data
await download_range(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
)

# Read it back as a pandas DataFrame
df = read_tick_data(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
)

print(df.head())
# time                     ask        bid      ask_volume  bid_volume
# 2024-01-01 00:00:01.234  2062.450  2062.430  1500000    2300000
```

### Speed It Up with Proxies
```python
# Use multiple proxies to distribute load and avoid rate limits
await download_range(
    symbol='EURUSD',
    start=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    end=datetime.now(),
    proxies=[
        'http://proxy1.example.com:8080',
        'http://proxy2.example.com:8080',
        'http://proxy3.example.com:8080'
    ]
)

# With 3 proxies × 10 workers each = 30 concurrent downloads
# That 12-day download? Now it's hours.
```

### Configuration
```python
from tick_vault import reload_config

# Customize settings
reload_config(
    base_directory='./my_tick_data',
    worker_per_proxy=15,                # More workers per proxy
    fetch_max_retry_attempts=5,         # More retries for flaky connections
    metadata_update_batch_size=200      # Larger batches for efficiency
)
```

Or use environment variables:
```bash
export TICK_VAULT_BASE_DIRECTORY=/data/ticks
export TICK_VAULT_WORKER_PER_PROXY=15
export TICK_VAULT_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Resuming and Incremental Updates
```python
# Download interrupted? Just run it again
await download_range(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2020, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 1, 1)
)
# TickVault checks metadata, skips completed chunks, resumes where it left off

# Update with recent data
await download_range(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 3, 1),
    end=datetime.now()
)
# Only fetches the new chunks, leaves historical data untouched
```

### Data Validation
```python
# Strict mode (default): ensures no gaps in data
df = read_tick_data(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1),
    strict=True  # Raises error if any hours are missing
)

# Non-strict mode: clips to available data range
df = read_tick_data(
    symbol='XAUUSD',
    start=datetime(2020, 1, 1),  # May be before first available
    end=datetime(2030, 1, 1),    # May be after last available
    strict=False  # Automatically adjusts to what exists
)
```

### Working with Metadata
```python
from tick_vault.metadata import MetadataDB

with MetadataDB() as db:
    # Check what's available
    first = db.first_chunk('XAUUSD')
    last = db.last_chunk('XAUUSD')
    print(f"Data range: {first.time} to {last.time}")
    
    # Find what needs downloading
    pending = db.find_not_attempted_chunks(
        symbol='EURUSD',
        start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
    )
    print(f"{len(pending)} chunks remaining")
    
    # Verify continuity
    db.check_for_gaps(
        symbol='XAUUSD',
        start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        end=datetime(2024, 2, 1)
    )  # Raises RuntimeError if gaps exist
```

### Custom Price Scales
```python
# For symbols not in the built-in registry
df = read_tick_data(
    symbol='CUSTOM_PAIR',
    start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2024, 2, 1),
    pipet_scale=0.01  # Specify your own scaling factor
)
```

## What's Next

TickVault works well for my needs, but there's room to grow. Here's what's on the roadmap:

**Download Pipeline:**
- Async stop events for cleaner worker termination (currently uses sentinel values)
- Dynamic worker auto-balancing with throughput monitoring
- Adaptive scaling: gradually increase workers until throughput plateaus, then back off

**Reading Pipeline:**
- Multi-threading and multi-processing support for parallel decoding
- Streaming decode-to-SQLite pipeline for memory-efficient querying
- HDF5 storage backend option for large datasets

**Developer Experience:**
- CLI interface for common operations (`tickvault download XAUUSD --start 2024-01-01`)
- Comprehensive pytest test suite
- Jupyter notebook tutorials and usage examples
- Better documentation with real-world patterns

**General:**
- Reorganized module structure as the codebase grows
- Unified `download_and_read()` convenience function
- More symbols added to the pipet scale registry

The core is stable. These are refinements, not fundamental changes. If you have ideas or want to contribute, issues and PRs are welcome.

## Try It

TickVault is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/keyhankamyar/TickVault). If you've ever fought with financial data pipelines, give it a shot:
```bash
pip install tick-vault
```

**If it solves a problem for you, star the repo.** Stars help other researchers find tools that actually work.

**If you find issues or have ideas,** open an issue or PR. The codebase is small enough to understand in an afternoon—`tick_vault/` is ~1,500 lines across 13 modules.

**If you just want to follow along,** I'll be writing more about the RL research this was built for, the performance optimizations, and lessons from building production data pipelines.

---

I built TickVault because I needed tick data for reinforcement learning research and nothing else worked well enough. Turns out "download financial data reliably" is harder than it sounds.

If you're in the same boat—tired of resampled data, broken tools, and expensive APIs—this might help.
