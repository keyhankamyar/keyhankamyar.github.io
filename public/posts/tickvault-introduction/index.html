Your model says enter at $1,850.23, exit at $1,850.89—but your hourly candle shows High: $1,851.20, Low: $1,849.80. Did your stop-loss trigger first, or did you hit take-profit? The data doesn’t tell you.\nTools that break at scale. Libraries that crash on large downloads, can’t resume, take forever to decode, or try to load everything into memory. Half are abandoned, the other half weren’t built for production workloads.\nRate limits that turn a 3-day download into a 3-week ordeal. Dukascopy’s free datafeed is great—until you need 30 symbols across 20 years and you suddenly realize bottlenecked at 5 requests per second.\nExpensive APIs for data that should be free. Why pay hundreds per month when the raw data exists, if only there was a decent way to access it?\nOver the past few months, I downloaded and decoded 2,000,000+ hours of tick data from Dukascopy. Not because I enjoy infrastructure work—because I needed it for reinforcement learning research. So I built TickVault.\nThe Design I built TickVault around three principles:\nMirror Dukascopy’s structure 1:1. No reformatting, no “clever” reorganization. The filesystem layout matches the source URLs exactly. No surprises when you need to debug. Single source of truth.\nStore raw, compressed data. Keep the original .bi5 files as-is. If you change your resampling strategy in 6 months, you don’t re-download terabytes. If you need to reproduce results from a year ago, the data hasn’t been pre-processed into irrelevance. ELT over ETL—extract and store, transform when you need it.\nDecode on-demand. You want one day of EUR/USD? Decompress those 24 hourly chunks. You want 5 years of 30 symbols? Same code path, just more chunks. Memory usage stays constant because you’re not loading everything upfront.\nHere’s what that looks like in practice:\npip install tick-vault Download a month of gold tick data:\nfrom datetime import datetime from tick_vault import download_range await download_range( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) Read it back as a pandas DataFrame:\nfrom tick_vault import read_tick_data df = read_tick_data( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) print(df.head()) # time ask bid ask_volume bid_volume # 2024-01-01 00:00:01.234 2062.450 2062.430 150 230 # ... Why Existing Solutions Fall Short Why Tick Data? The Resampling Trap Most data sources give you pre-resampled data—hourly candles, 5-minute bars, daily OHLC. But who decided that’s the right granularity for your problem?\nAssumptions are the worse enemy of Machine Learning models. Let me explain more:\nMachine Learning models are “function approximators”. They will see what a function inputs, and what it outputs and try their best to mimic the behavior of that function that would results into the outcome. You wouldn’t expect a function to receive only a subset of the inputs it needs and still give you the same output, would you? So we need to give all of the required inputs to a model, then hope that model learns to output the correct label.\nTick data has some problems as it’s raw form:\nIt is too granular, this leads to huge dimensions and massive memory and compute requirements It is irregular and does not follow a structured pattern in time So, traditional approaches was to simply bin them, or “Resample” them. We would bucket the data into bins, and just handpicked some values. This was a more eye-pleasing and manageable approach for human interaction. This approach had several issues. Some top ones among them:\nWhat if a certain event happens so quickly that fits into one bucket? We used multiple bucket size representations also known as multi “timeframe charts” to try to mitigate that. What if there are some time cyclical pattern in data that because of our arbitrary choice of bin width(timeframe) we lose that view/insight? What features do we have to choose from each bucket? Traditionally OHLC or Open, High, Low, Close Resampled data breaks risk calculations in back-testing. Say your strategy generates an entry at $1,850.23 and an exit at $1,850.89—a tight 66-pip window. Your stop-loss is at $1,849.95. The next hourly candle shows [Open: $1,850.10, High: $1,851.20, Low: $1,849.80, Close: $1,850.95]. Did you hit your take-profit at $1,850.89? Or did the price drop to $1,849.95 first and stop you out? The candle doesn’t tell you. You can’t calculate your actual risk, can’t validate your strategy, can’t trust your backtest. Even if your entry and exit are far apart, sudden volatility can create the same problem. A single hourly candle that spans $10 might contain a flash crash that would have stopped you out—but the OHLC makes it look like smooth sailing. We had to make so many assumptions that we did not know if they are correct or not. If you’re training an ML model, why would you assume 1-hour bins are the optimal feature resolution? And even if hourly happens to work, why assume that Open, High, Low, Close captures what matters? You’re throwing away every tick between those four points and the order of events.\nIf you’re serious about modeling market dynamics, you need tick-level data. Everything else is a lossy approximation.\nTools That Don’t Scale So you decide you need tick data. After some search you figure out your best bet for high quality data is dukascopy. You search GitHub for “dukascopy python” and find… a graveyard.\nHalf the repos haven’t been touched in 3+ years. Broken dependencies, no type hints, no tests. READMEs that promise but crash on Python 3.12. They worked once, for someone, in 2018.\nThe active ones weren’t built for production ML. You start downloading 2 years of EUR/USD. Six hours in, your connection drops. Start over from scratch—there’s no resume logic. Or manually read the logs, study the architecture and try to figure out what is missing, make a script and pray your script handles partial state.\nMemory management is an afterthought. Some libraries load entire datasets into RAM before processing. Fine for a weekend of data. Catastrophic when you need 10 years across 30 symbols.\nDecoding is painfully slow. Single-threaded, pure Python loops processing millions of ticks. Every inefficiency compounds when you’re working at scale. What should take minutes takes hours.\nI used to alo duct-tape together scripts for a while—custom resume logic, manual retry handling, homegrown decoders. Then I got tired of maintaining infrastructure when I should have been training models.\nThe Bandwidth Bottleneck Dukascopy’s datafeed is free and high-quality. It’s also aggressively rate-limited.\nYou can download maybe 5-10 requests per second before you start getting 429s ( errors) or 503s (service unavailable). That’s fine if you’re grabbing a week of one symbol. It’s a nightmare when you need:\n30 currency pairs 20 years of history each 24 hourly chunks per day = 5,256,000 individual requests At 5 requests/second with perfect uptime, that’s 12 days of continuous downloading. In practice, with retries, backoff delays, and occasional connection issues? Closer to 3 weeks.\nAnd that’s assuming you’re using a single connection. Most libraries don’t support concurrent downloads, let alone load distribution. You’re stuck babysitting a script for weeks, hoping nothing crashes overnight.\nThe bottleneck isn’t your internet connection. It’s the architecture of the tools.\nThe Cost vs Quality Tradeoff You could just pay for data. Plenty of vendors will sell you tick data—$X/month, enterprise contracts with minimums.\nFor a hedge fund, that’s a rounding error. For an independent researcher, a grad student, or someone in a country where $500/month is twice a salary? It’s a non-starter.\nAnd you’re often paying for convenience, not quality. Many paid APIs are just reselling the same Dukascopy data you could get for free, wrapped in a nicer interface. You’re paying someone else to solve the problem.\nWhich would be fine—if the free tools actually worked. But they don’t. So you’re stuck choosing between:\nExpensive APIs that solve the problem but price out independent research Free data that’s high-quality but inaccessible without building infrastructure Resampled garbage that’s easy to get but useless for serious work There should be a fourth option: free, high-quality, and actually usable at scale. That’s what TickVault is.\nHow TickVault Works Differently I didn’t want to build “yet another Dukascopy wrapper.” I wanted to solve the underlying architectural problems that make existing tools fragile. A minimal, pythonic, type-safe, performant, and scalable solution.\nStore Raw, Mirror 1:1 TickVault’s filesystem structure mirrors Dukascopy’s URL structure exactly:\ntick_vault_data/ └── downloads/ └── XAUUSD/ └── 2024/ └── 02/ # Month: 0-indexed (00=Jan, 11=Dec) └── 15/ # Day ├── 00h_ticks.bi5 ├── 01h_ticks.bi5 └── ... Every file is stored in its original compressed .bi5 format. No reformatting, no “clever” reorganization, no pre-processing.\nWhy this matters:\nSingle source of truth. When something breaks, you know exactly where to look. The file at XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5 corresponds to https://datafeed.dukascopy.com/datafeed/XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5. No mental mapping required.\nReproducibility. Your resampling strategy from 6 months ago produced different results today? The raw data hasn’t changed—you can investigate. With pre-processed data, you’re just guessing.\nStorage efficiency. Compressed tick data is surprisingly small. 20 years of Gold (200,000+ hourly files) is \u003c15GB. Keep the originals, transform on-demand.\nFuture-proof. Decide you need millisecond timestamps instead of your current second-level precision? The raw ticks are still there. You’re not locked into past decisions.\nThis is ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) instead of ETL. Get the data once, transform it however many times you need.\nMetadata-Driven Resume Every download attempt gets tracked in a SQLite database:\nmetadata.db ├── symbol_XAUUSD │ ├── timestamp: 1704067200 (2024-01-01 00:00 UTC) │ ├── has_data: 1 │ └── ... └── symbol_EURUSD └── ... Each symbol gets its own table. Each hour gets a row with two pieces of information:\nDid we attempt to download it? Does data exist for this hour? (Some hours legitimately have no data—weekends for forex, market holidays, etc.) Why this matters:\nTrue resume capability. Your download crashes at hour 50,000? Run the same command again. TickVault checks the database, skips what’s already done, continues from where it left off. No manual state tracking.\nIncremental updates. Downloaded data through March? Now it’s June? Just set end=datetime.now() and TickVault only fetches the new chunks. Your historical data stays untouched.\nGap detection. Before reading data, TickVault verifies continuity. Missing hours in the middle of your range? It tells you before you waste time on a broken dataset.\nThe producer-consumer pattern: Download workers (producers) fetch chunks concurrently and push results to a queue. A single metadata worker (consumer) batches database writes. This avoids database lock contention while maintaining consistency—even with 500 parallel workers hammering away.\nParallel Everything TickVault’s download architecture is built around concurrency:\nOrchestrator ├── Proxy A → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N ├── Proxy B → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N └── Proxy C → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N ↓ Result Queue ↓ Metadata Worker (single writer) Each proxy gets its own pool of async workers (default: 10 per proxy). Each worker:\nPulls a chunk from the work queue Fetches it via httpx with retry logic Saves the compressed data to disk Reports the result to the metadata worker Why this matters:\nSpeed. With 7 proxies and 10 workers each, you’re making 70 concurrent requests. That 12-day download? Now it’s done in hours.\nRate limit mitigation. Dukascopy rate-limits per IP. Distributing requests across proxies means you’re not constantly hitting limits and backing off.\nFault tolerance. One worker hangs? The other 69 keep going. One proxy gets blocked? Its workers fail gracefully while the others continue. The orchestrator handles backpressure—if downloads are faster than metadata writes, the queue fills up and workers naturally slow down.\nExponential backoff with context. Transient network error? Retry with increasing delays. Rate limit with Retry-After header? Respect it. Forbidden/blocked? Fail fast and stop wasting time.\nThe async architecture means you’re not waiting on I/O. While one worker is waiting for a response, 69 others are fetching, decoding, or writing.\nDecode On-Demand TickVault doesn’t pre-process anything. The .bi5 files stay compressed on disk until you actually need them.\nWhen you call read_tick_data():\nQuery the metadata database for available chunks in your time range Verify there are no gaps (fail fast if data is incomplete) Load each compressed chunk sequentially Decompress with LZMA, decode with NumPy structured arrays, fully vectorized Why this matters:\nFlexibility. Want to resample to 5-minute bars today and 1-second bars tomorrow? The raw ticks are still there. Want to calculate VWAP using actual volumes instead of approximations? You have the data. Every transformation is non-destructive.\nFast enough. Decompression and decoding are fast—LZMA is optimized, NumPy handles binary parsing efficiently. For most use cases, the bottleneck is your analysis code, not the data loading.\nComing soon: Incremental decode-to-database pipelines. Stream chunks directly to SQLite or HDF5 for efficient querying without loading into memory. Same raw source files, different materialization strategies—pick what fits your workflow. You can store N-TB of compressed data and work with 1GB at a time. The same code works whether you’re reading one day or ten years—memory usage stays constant because you’re streaming through chunks, not loading everything upfront.\nThe pattern is simple: download once, transform many times. Keep the highest-resolution version, derive everything else as needed.\nNow Some Code Basic Workflow “pip install tick-vault” if you haven’t already!\nDownload and read:\nfrom datetime import datetime from tick_vault import download_range, read_tick_data # Download a month of gold tick data await download_range( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) # Read it back as a pandas DataFrame df = read_tick_data( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) print(df.head()) # time ask bid ask_volume bid_volume # 2024-01-01 00:00:01.234 2062.450 2062.430 1500000 2300000 Speed It Up with Proxies # Use multiple proxies to distribute load and avoid rate limits await download_range( symbol='EURUSD', start=datetime(2000, 1, 1), end=None, # Or datetime.now() for the same effect proxies=[ 'http://proxy1.example.com:8080', 'http://proxy2.example.com:8080', 'http://proxy3.example.com:8080' ] ) Configuration from tick_vault import reload_config # Customize settings reload_config( base_directory='./my_tick_data', worker_per_proxy=15, # More workers per proxy fetch_max_retry_attempts=5, # More retries for flaky connections metadata_update_batch_size=200 # Larger batches for efficiency ) Or use environment variables:\nexport TICK_VAULT_BASE_DIRECTORY=/data/ticks export TICK_VAULT_WORKER_PER_PROXY=15 export TICK_VAULT_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO Full configuration reference in the repo\nResuming and Incremental Updates # Download interrupted? Just run it again await download_range( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2020, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 1, 1) ) # TickVault checks metadata, skips completed chunks, resumes where it left off # Update with recent data await download_range( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 3, 1), end=datetime.now() ) # Only fetches the new chunks, leaves historical data untouched Data Validation # Strict mode (default): ensures the exact provided range is present df = read_tick_data( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1), strict=True # Raises error if any hours are missing ) # Non-strict mode: clips to available data range, still raises error if there are gaps between df = read_tick_data( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2020, 1, 1), # May be before first available end=datetime(2030, 1, 1), # May be after last available strict=False # Automatically adjusts to what exists ) Working with Metadata from tick_vault.metadata import MetadataDB with MetadataDB() as db: # Check what's available first = db.first_chunk('XAUUSD') last = db.last_chunk('XAUUSD') print(f\"Data range: {first.time} to {last.time}\") # Find what needs downloading pending = db.find_not_attempted_chunks( symbol='EURUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) print(f\"{len(pending)} chunks remaining\") # Verify continuity db.check_for_gaps( symbol='XAUUSD', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1) ) # Raises RuntimeError if gaps exist Custom Price Scales # For symbols not in the built-in registry df = read_tick_data( symbol='CUSTOM_PAIR', start=datetime(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime(2024, 2, 1), pipet_scale=0.01 # Specify your own scaling factor ) What’s Next TickVault works well for my needs, but there’s room to grow. Here’s what’s on the roadmap:\nDownload Pipeline:\nDynamic worker auto-balancing with throughput monitoring Adaptive scaling: gradually increase workers until throughput plateaus, then back off Async stop events for cleaner worker termination (currently uses sentinel values) Reading Pipeline:\nMulti-threading and multi-processing support for parallel decoding. Not generally needed since it is mostly I/O bound but for rapid SSDs might come handy! Streaming decode-to-SQLite pipeline for memory-efficient querying HDF5 storage backend option for large datasets Developer Experience:\nCLI interface for common operations (tickvault download XAUUSD --start 2024-01-01) Comprehensive pytest test suite General:\nReorganized module structure as the codebase grows Unified download_and_read() convenience function, so you don’t have to call two functions 🥱 More symbols added to the pipet scale registry The core is stable. These are refinements, not fundamental changes. If you have ideas or want to contribute, issues and PRs are welcome.\nTry It TickVault is open source on GitHub. If you’ve ever fought with financial data pipelines, give it a shot:\npip install tick-vault If it solves a problem for you, star the repo. Stars help other researchers find tools that actually work.\nIf you find issues or have ideas, open an issue or PR. The codebase is minimal and clean enough to understand in an afternoon.\nIf you just want to follow along, I’ll be writing more about the RL research this was built for, the performance optimizations, and lessons from building production data pipelines.\nI built TickVault because I needed tick data for reinforcement learning research and nothing else worked well enough.\nIf you’re in the same boat—tired of resampled data, broken tools, and expensive APIs—this might help.\nGitHub: keyhankamyar/TickVault\nLinkedIn: keyhan-kamyar\n","wordCount":"2862","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://keyhankamyar.github.io/images/tickvault-og.png","datePublished":"2025-10-15T12:00:00+03:30","dateModified":"2025-10-15T12:00:00+03:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Keyhan Kamyar"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://keyhankamyar.github.io/posts/tickvault-introduction/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Keyhan Kamyar","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://keyhankamyar.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://keyhankamyar.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Keyhan Kamyar (Alt + H)">Keyhan Kamyar</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Your model says enter at $1,850.23, exit at $1,850.89—but your hourly candle shows High: $1,851.20, Low: $1,849.80. Did your stop-loss trigger first, or did you hit take-profit? The data doesn&rsquo;t tell you.</p><p><strong>Tools that break at scale</strong>. Libraries that crash on large downloads, can&rsquo;t resume, take forever to decode, or try to load everything into memory. Half are abandoned, the other half weren&rsquo;t built for production workloads.</p><p><strong>Rate limits</strong> that turn a 3-day download into a 3-week ordeal. Dukascopy&rsquo;s free datafeed is great—until you need 30 symbols across 20 years and you suddenly realize bottlenecked at 5 requests per second.</p><p><strong>Expensive APIs</strong> for data that should be free. Why pay hundreds per month when the raw data exists, if only there was a decent way to access it?</p><p>Over the past few months, I downloaded and decoded 2,000,000+ hours of tick data from Dukascopy. Not because I enjoy infrastructure work—because I needed it for reinforcement learning research. So I built TickVault.</p><h2 id=the-design>The Design<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-design>#</a></h2><p>I built TickVault around three principles:</p><p><strong>Mirror Dukascopy&rsquo;s structure 1:1.</strong> No reformatting, no &ldquo;clever&rdquo; reorganization. The filesystem layout matches the source URLs exactly. No surprises when you need to debug. Single source of truth.</p><p><strong>Store raw, compressed data.</strong> Keep the original .bi5 files as-is. If you change your resampling strategy in 6 months, you don&rsquo;t re-download terabytes. If you need to reproduce results from a year ago, the data hasn&rsquo;t been pre-processed into irrelevance. ELT over ETL—extract and store, transform when you need it.</p><p><strong>Decode on-demand.</strong> You want one day of EUR/USD? Decompress those 24 hourly chunks. You want 5 years of 30 symbols? Same code path, just more chunks. Memory usage stays constant because you&rsquo;re not loading everything upfront.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what that looks like in practice:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>pip install tick-vault

The Resampling Trap<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-tick-data-the-resampling-trap>#</a></h3><p>Most data sources give you pre-resampled data—hourly candles, 5-minute bars, daily OHLC. But who decided that&rsquo;s the right granularity for your problem?</p><p>Assumptions are the worse enemy of Machine Learning models. Let me explain more:</p><p>Machine Learning models are <strong>&ldquo;function approximators&rdquo;</strong>. They will see what a function inputs, and what it outputs and try their best to mimic the behavior of that function that would results into the outcome. You wouldn&rsquo;t expect a function to receive only a subset of the inputs it needs and still give you the same output, would you? So we need to give all of the required inputs to a model, then hope that model learns to output the correct label.</p><p>Tick data has some problems as it&rsquo;s raw form:</p><ul><li>It is too granular, this leads to huge dimensions and massive memory and compute requirements</li><li>It is irregular and does not follow a structured pattern in time</li></ul><p>So, traditional approaches was to simply bin them, or &ldquo;Resample&rdquo; them. We would bucket the data into bins, and just handpicked some values. This was a more eye-pleasing and manageable approach for human interaction. This approach had several issues. Some top ones among them:</p><ul><li>What if a certain event happens so quickly that fits into one bucket? We used multiple bucket size representations also known as multi <strong>&ldquo;timeframe charts&rdquo;</strong> to try to mitigate that.</li><li>What if there are some time cyclical pattern in data that because of our arbitrary choice of bin width(timeframe) we lose that view/insight?</li><li>What features do we have to choose from each bucket? Traditionally OHLC or Open, High, Low, Close</li><li>Resampled data breaks risk calculations in back-testing. Say your strategy generates an entry at $1,850.23 and an exit at $1,850.89—a tight 66-pip window. Your stop-loss is at $1,849.95. The next hourly candle shows [Open: $1,850.10, High: $1,851.20, Low: $1,849.80, Close: $1,850.95]. Did you hit your take-profit at $1,850.89? Or did the price drop to $1,849.95 first and stop you out? <strong>The candle doesn&rsquo;t tell you.</strong> You can&rsquo;t calculate your actual risk, can&rsquo;t validate your strategy, can&rsquo;t trust your backtest. Even if your entry and exit are far apart, sudden volatility can create the same problem. A single hourly candle that spans $10 might contain a flash crash that would have stopped you out—but the OHLC makes it look like smooth sailing.</li></ul><p>We had to make so many assumptions that we did not know if they are correct or not. If you&rsquo;re training an ML model, why would you assume 1-hour bins are the optimal feature resolution? And even if hourly happens to work, why assume that Open, High, Low, Close captures what matters? You&rsquo;re throwing away every tick between those four points and the order of events.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re serious about modeling market dynamics, you need tick-level data. Everything else is a lossy approximation.</p><h3 id=tools-that-dont-scale>Tools That Don&rsquo;t Scale<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tools-that-dont-scale>#</a></h3><p>So you decide you need tick data. After some search you figure out your best bet for high quality data is dukascopy. You search GitHub for &ldquo;dukascopy python&rdquo; and find&mldr; a graveyard.</p><p><strong>Half the repos haven&rsquo;t been touched in 3+ years.</strong> Broken dependencies, no type hints, no tests. READMEs that promise but crash on Python 3.12. They worked once, for someone, in 2018.</p><p><strong>The active ones weren&rsquo;t built for production ML.</strong> You start downloading 2 years of EUR/USD. Six hours in, your connection drops. Start over from scratch—there&rsquo;s no resume logic. Or manually read the logs, study the architecture and try to figure out what is missing, make a script and pray your script handles partial state.</p><p><strong>Memory management is an afterthought.</strong> Some libraries load entire datasets into RAM before processing. Fine for a weekend of data. Catastrophic when you need 10 years across 30 symbols.</p><p><strong>Decoding is painfully slow.</strong> Single-threaded, pure Python loops processing millions of ticks. Every inefficiency compounds when you&rsquo;re working at scale. What should take minutes takes hours.</p><p>I used to alo duct-tape together scripts for a while—custom resume logic, manual retry handling, homegrown decoders. Then I got tired of maintaining infrastructure when I should have been training models.</p><h3 id=the-bandwidth-bottleneck>The Bandwidth Bottleneck<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bandwidth-bottleneck>#</a></h3><p>Dukascopy&rsquo;s datafeed is free and high-quality. It&rsquo;s also aggressively rate-limited.</p><p>You can download maybe 5-10 requests per second before you start getting 429s ( errors) or 503s (service unavailable). That&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re grabbing a week of one symbol. It&rsquo;s a nightmare when you need:</p><ul><li>30 currency pairs</li><li>20 years of history each</li><li>24 hourly chunks per day</li><li>= 5,256,000 individual requests</li></ul><p>At 5 requests/second with perfect uptime, that&rsquo;s <strong>12 days of continuous downloading.</strong> In practice, with retries, backoff delays, and occasional connection issues? Closer to 3 weeks.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s assuming you&rsquo;re using a single connection. Most libraries don&rsquo;t support concurrent downloads, let alone load distribution. You&rsquo;re stuck babysitting a script for weeks, hoping nothing crashes overnight.</p><p><strong>The bottleneck isn&rsquo;t your internet connection. It&rsquo;s the architecture of the tools.</strong></p><h3 id=the-cost-vs-quality-tradeoff>The Cost vs Quality Tradeoff<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-cost-vs-quality-tradeoff>#</a></h3><p>You could just pay for data. Plenty of vendors will sell you tick data—$X/month, enterprise contracts with minimums.</p><p>For a hedge fund, that&rsquo;s a rounding error. For an independent researcher, a grad student, or someone in a country where $500/month is twice a salary? It&rsquo;s a non-starter.</p><p>And you&rsquo;re often paying for <strong>convenience, not quality.</strong> Many paid APIs are just reselling the same Dukascopy data you could get for free, wrapped in a nicer interface. You&rsquo;re paying someone else to solve the problem.</p><p>Which would be fine—if the free tools actually worked. But they don&rsquo;t. So you&rsquo;re stuck choosing between:</p><ul><li>Expensive APIs that solve the problem but price out independent research</li><li>Free data that&rsquo;s high-quality but inaccessible without building infrastructure</li><li>Resampled garbage that&rsquo;s easy to get but useless for serious work</li></ul><p><strong>There should be a fourth option: free, high-quality, and actually usable at scale.</strong> That&rsquo;s what TickVault is.</p><h2 id=how-tickvault-works-differently>How TickVault Works Differently<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-tickvault-works-differently>#</a></h2><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to build &ldquo;yet another Dukascopy wrapper.&rdquo; I wanted to solve the underlying architectural problems that make existing tools fragile. A minimal, pythonic, type-safe, performant, and scalable solution.</p><h3 id=store-raw-mirror-11>Store Raw, Mirror 1:1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#store-raw-mirror-11>#</a></h3><p>TickVault&rsquo;s filesystem structure mirrors Dukascopy&rsquo;s URL structure exactly:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>tick_vault_data/

</code></pre><p>Every file is stored in its original compressed <code>.bi5</code> format. No reformatting, no &ldquo;clever&rdquo; reorganization, no pre-processing.</p><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p><p><strong>Single source of truth.</strong> When something breaks, you know exactly where to look. The file at <code>XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5</code> corresponds to <code>https://datafeed.dukascopy.com/datafeed/XAUUSD/2024/02/15/14h_ticks.bi5</code>. No mental mapping required.</p><p><strong>Reproducibility.</strong> Your resampling strategy from 6 months ago produced different results today? The raw data hasn&rsquo;t changed—you can investigate. With pre-processed data, you&rsquo;re just guessing.</p><p><strong>Storage efficiency.</strong> Compressed tick data is surprisingly small. 20 years of Gold (200,000+ hourly files) is &lt;15GB. Keep the originals, transform on-demand.</p><p><strong>Future-proof.</strong> Decide you need millisecond timestamps instead of your current second-level precision? The raw ticks are still there. You&rsquo;re not locked into past decisions.</p><p>This is ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) instead of ETL. Get the data once, transform it however many times you need.</p><h3 id=metadata-driven-resume>Metadata-Driven Resume<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#metadata-driven-resume>#</a></h3><p>Every download attempt gets tracked in a SQLite database:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>metadata.db

└── symbol_EURUSD
    └── ...
</code></pre><p>Each symbol gets its own table. Each hour gets a row with two pieces of information:</p><ol><li>Did we attempt to download it?</li><li>Does data exist for this hour? (Some hours legitimately have no data—weekends for forex, market holidays, etc.)</li></ol><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p><p><strong>True resume capability.</strong> Your download crashes at hour 50,000? Run the same command again. TickVault checks the database, skips what&rsquo;s already done, continues from where it left off. No manual state tracking.</p><p><strong>Incremental updates.</strong> Downloaded data through March? Now it&rsquo;s June? Just set <code>end=datetime.now()</code> and TickVault only fetches the new chunks. Your historical data stays untouched.</p><p><strong>Gap detection.</strong> Before reading data, TickVault verifies continuity. Missing hours in the middle of your range? It tells you before you waste time on a broken dataset.</p><p><strong>The producer-consumer pattern:</strong> Download workers (producers) fetch chunks concurrently and push results to a queue. A single metadata worker (consumer) batches database writes. This avoids database lock contention while maintaining consistency—even with 500 parallel workers hammering away.</p><h3 id=parallel-everything>Parallel Everything<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#parallel-everything>#</a></h3><p>TickVault&rsquo;s download architecture is built around concurrency:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Orchestrator
├── Proxy A → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
├── Proxy B → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
└── Proxy C → Worker 1, Worker 2, ..., Worker N
     ↓
  Result Queue
     ↓
  Metadata Worker (single writer)
</code></pre><p>Each proxy gets its own pool of async workers (default: 10 per proxy). Each worker:</p><ol><li>Pulls a chunk from the work queue</li><li>Fetches it via <code>httpx</code> with retry logic</li><li>Saves the compressed data to disk</li><li>Reports the result to the metadata worker</li></ol><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> With 7 proxies and 10 workers each, you&rsquo;re making 70 concurrent requests. That 12-day download? Now it&rsquo;s done in hours.</p><p><strong>Rate limit mitigation.</strong> Dukascopy rate-limits per IP. Distributing requests across proxies means you&rsquo;re not constantly hitting limits and backing off.</p><p><strong>Fault tolerance.</strong> One worker hangs? The other 69 keep going. One proxy gets blocked? Its workers fail gracefully while the others continue. The orchestrator handles backpressure—if downloads are faster than metadata writes, the queue fills up and workers naturally slow down.</p><p><strong>Exponential backoff with context.</strong> Transient network error? Retry with increasing delays. Rate limit with <code>Retry-After</code> header? Respect it. Forbidden/blocked? Fail fast and stop wasting time.</p><p>The async architecture means you&rsquo;re not waiting on I/O. While one worker is waiting for a response, 69 others are fetching, decoding, or writing.</p><h3 id=decode-on-demand>Decode On-Demand<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#decode-on-demand>#</a></h3><p>TickVault doesn&rsquo;t pre-process anything. The <code>.bi5</code> files stay compressed on disk until you actually need them.</p><p>When you call <code>read_tick_data()</code>:</p><ol><li>Query the metadata database for available chunks in your time range</li><li>Verify there are no gaps (fail fast if data is incomplete)</li><li>Load each compressed chunk sequentially</li><li>Decompress with LZMA, decode with NumPy structured arrays, fully vectorized</li></ol><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p><p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Want to resample to 5-minute bars today and 1-second bars tomorrow? The raw ticks are still there. Want to calculate VWAP using actual volumes instead of approximations? You have the data. Every transformation is non-destructive.</p><p><strong>Fast enough.</strong> Decompression and decoding are fast—LZMA is optimized, NumPy handles binary parsing efficiently. For most use cases, the bottleneck is your analysis code, not the data loading.</p><p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> Incremental decode-to-database pipelines. Stream chunks directly to SQLite or HDF5 for efficient querying without loading into memory. Same raw source files, different materialization strategies—pick what fits your workflow. You can store N-TB of compressed data and work with 1GB at a time. The same code works whether you&rsquo;re reading one day or ten years—memory usage stays constant because you&rsquo;re streaming through chunks, not loading everything upfront.</p><p>The pattern is simple: <strong>download once, transform many times.</strong> Keep the highest-resolution version, derive everything else as needed.</p><h2 id=now-some-code>Now Some Code<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#now-some-code>#</a></h2><h3 id=basic-workflow>Basic Workflow<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#basic-workflow>#</a></h3><p>&ldquo;pip install tick-vault&rdquo; if you haven&rsquo;t already!</p><p>Download and read:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kn>from</span> <span class=nn>datetime</span> <span class=kn>import</span> <span class=n>datetime</span>
